A website/app to see if my friends are streaming or not


In this site im using the twitch API to make calls to the channel of the people i want information about to tell me 
if they are live steraming or not and change a status on the site.

This is so I don't need to download the twitch app on my devices and have the web/app running all the time to put it 
on my room to see easyly.
